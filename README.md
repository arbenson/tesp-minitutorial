### Jupyter notebooks accompanying the slides of the "Tensor Eigenvectors and Stochastic Processes" (TESP) mini-tutorial at SIAM ALA 2018.

See http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/tesp for more information on the minitutorial.

This respository contains notebooks and codes for some of the results presented in the tutorial.



### Stochastic processes

Jupyter notebook for the examples of stochastic processesare in `stochastic-processes.ipynb`.



### RWs, non-backtracking RWs, and spacey RWs

There are two Jupyter notebooks for the two examples comparing random walks, non-backtracking random walks, and (super) spacey random walks for the 3-node and 7-node graph examples:

- `3-node-cycle-walks.ipynb`
- `7-node-line-walks.ipynb`



### Graph random walk animations


Several of the animations for (non-backtracing) random walks are in the script `animate_random_walk.jl `.
